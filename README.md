## Shiny Attrition Model

### Required Files: 
Data folder containing the required dataset "employees.csv". 
Shiny.R - this will need to be run use the prediction model
employee_attrition.html - this is the output of the Rmd file and it goes over the project in detail

### Shiny.R 
This file produces the prediction model. The prediction model has two tabs to each with a different option of predicting attrition. The 'Single Prediction' tab allows the user to input/select from the predictors to obtain the probability of an employee attriting. The 'Predict from csv' tab allows the user to input a csv containing multiple rows of data to make predictions for each. The prediction can be found in the far right column. I have provided a csv file "test.csv" to test the upload csv feature of this app. 

### Optional Files
employee_attrition.Rmd - this Rmd file was used to produce the html output. This is only provided for reference.
employee_attrition.R - this was the original file from which the Shiny model and the employee_attrition.Rmd file were created in. This is only provided for reference.
